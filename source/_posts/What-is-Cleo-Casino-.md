#  What is the Cleo Casino poker? 

The Cleo Casino poker is a variant of the five card stud poker game. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and incorporates variations of the traditional poker rules. The goal of the game is to create the best five-card hand using any combination of the seven cards available to each player (the five face down cards and the two face up community cards). 

The Cleo Casino poker can be played with two or more players. The game begins by each player being dealt two cards face down, and one card face up. The face up card is placed in the middle of the table, and is known as the "flop". The dealer then deals three more community cards, also placing them in the middle of the table. Players then use any combination of their seven cards to create their best possible hand. The best hand wins the pot. 

If there is a tie for the best hand, the pot is divided evenly between all players with the best hand. If there is no clear winner, the player who was first to bet or raise during that particular round wins the pot. 

# How to Play Cleo Casino Poker 

To begin play, each player is dealt two cards face down and one card face up. The face up card is placed in front of the player and is called the "flop". Three community cards are then dealt face up in the center of all players. These are also referred to as "The Board".

Players now have 7 possible cards to make their best 5-card poker hand from (2 from their personal hand PLUS 3 from "The Board"). Players MUST use 2 from their own hand PLUS 3 from "The Board" - they cannot use ALL 5 board cards! Using any combination of those 7 cards, players bet or fold depending on their starting hands. After all bets are made, another card (known as "The Turn") is flipped over - this gives players 6 potential remaining cards in their hand (2 + 4). Players again bet or fold according to strength of their hands at this point. Finally, after all bets are placed on this round - a 5th and FINAL community card (known as "The River") is flipped over - giving players just 1 potential card left in their hand! At this point, everyone reveals their hands and whoever has won takes ALL bets!

There are a few variations to betting during particular rounds too: 
- During "preflop", only amount wagered MUST be put back in pot if folding
- During "flop", all players who DIDN'T fold must put an extra bet in equal to what was already wagered
- During "turn" & "river", same as flop
