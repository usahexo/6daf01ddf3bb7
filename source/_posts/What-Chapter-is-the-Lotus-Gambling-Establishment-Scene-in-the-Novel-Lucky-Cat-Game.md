#  What Chapter is the Lotus Gambling Establishment Scene in the Novel Lucky Cat Game?

In the novel Lucky Cat Game by Natsuo Kirino, the Lotus Gambling Establishment scene is in Chapter 3. This is where protagonist Sakurai Makoto goes to with her friend Hashimoto Yuko in order to make some money. They are both out of work and need the cash.

The casino is a neon-lit and smoke-filled place that is a far cry from the orderly game parlors that Sakurai is used to. She and Yuko each put 300 yen into a machine and begin playing. Sakurai quickly loses all her money, but Yuko keeps playing and eventually wins 8000 yen.

Sakurai is amazed by Yuko's luck and asks her how she did it. Yuko tells her that she just focused on the numbers and didn't let herself get too excited or upset about her losses or wins. This advice comes in handy for Sakurai later in the novel when she finds herself in some tricky gambling situations.
