#  When Is Grand Victoria Casino Reopening? 1x2 Network Has The Answer!

The date is set! According to officials, the Grand Victoria Casino will reopen on September 3rd. This news comes shortly after the casino’s owner, Restoration Gaming, LLC, filed for bankruptcy in late July.

1x2 Network has all of the latest information on what this means for the casino and its guests. For starters, don’t worry – your loyalty points will still be valid! In addition, all of your favorite games will be available upon reopening.

There are a few things that will be changing, however. For one, the Grand Victoria Casino will now be known as Grand Victoria Resort and Casino. Additionally, there will be some new management in place. The new team is led by CEO Ron Hynes and President Al Campanella.

So what does this mean for guests? According to CEO Ron Hynes, “We have an experienced and dedicated team in place that is excited to take over operations and begin restoring the property to its former glory… We are committed to providing our guests with a first-class gaming experience and look forward to welcoming them back soon.”

Guests can expect many new changes and improvements under the new management team – including updates to the hotel, restaurants, spa, and more! So mark your calendars – September 3rd is right around the corner!

#  Grand Victoria Casino Set To Reopen On January 1st!

The much anticipated reopening of the Grand Victoria Casino is set for January 1st, 2020. The casino, which has been closed for over two years, is making a comeback with a refreshed look and new amenities.

One of the new features that guests can look forward to is the addition of a AAA steakhouse called Prime. This will be the only AAA steakhouse on the premises and it will feature USDA prime beef and an extensive wine list.

There will also be a brand new event center on site that will be able to accommodate up to 2,000 people. This space will be used for everything from corporate events to concerts.

In addition to these new additions, the casino will also be home to a brand new luxury hotel tower. This tower will have 400 rooms and suites, giving guests plenty of options when it comes to accommodation.

The Grand Victoria Casino is located in Elgin, Illinois and is just a short drive from Chicago. This makes it the perfect destination for those looking for a fun night out or even a weekend getaway.

#  What Does The Future Hold For Grand Victoria Casino?

The future of the Grand Victoria Casino is up in the air as its parent company, Eldorado Resorts, Inc. (ERI), looks to sell the property. ERI announced in February of 2019 that it was exploring "strategic alternatives" for the Grand Victoria, including a potential sale.

ERI has not released any further information about its plans for the Grand Victoria since then, but there is speculation that a buyer could be found before the end of the year. There are a number of interested parties, according to reports, including Caesars Entertainment Corporation (CZR) and MGM Resorts International (MGM).

If a sale does go through, it's not clear what that would mean for the future of the casino. It's possible that a new owner would keep it open, but it's also possible that it would close down. The Grand Victoria Casino employs about 2,000 people, so any closure would have a significant impact on the local economy.

The Grand Victoria Casino opened in August of 1999 and has been a major employer and economic driver in Elgin ever since. It has seen its fair share of ups and downs over the years, but it remains an important part of the community. If it closes down, it would be a major loss for Elgin and the surrounding area.
