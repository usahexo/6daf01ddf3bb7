#  Why Is Gambling Illegal In California, Reddit Users Wonder

A recent post on the social media platform Reddit has sparked debate over the legality of gambling in California. The post, which has since been deleted, asked why gambling is illegal in the state and garnered a number of responses from users.

While some believe that gambling should be illegal in California because it is a form of exploitation, others argue that it should be legalized and regulated in order to generate tax revenue for the state.

So, why is gambling illegal in California?

The short answer is that there is no one answer to this question. Gambling laws can vary from state to state, and even from county to county within a state. In general, however, gambling is considered to be illegal when it involves betting on games of chance or skill where the outcome depends on chance alone.

This definition can be interpreted quite broadly, and as a result, many forms of gambling are illegal in California. This includes traditional casino games like blackjack and poker, as well as lotteries and other forms of betting.

There are a few exceptions to this rule, however. For example, social gambling (i.e., gambling between friends for small stakes) is generally allowed in California. And while most forms of online gambling are currently illegal in the state, there are some exceptions for certain types of wagers (e.g., bets on horse races).

So why is gambling illegal in California? The answer to that question depends on who you ask.

#  Californians Ask Why Gambling Is Illegal

A recent poll of California voters showed that two-thirds want to see gambling legalized in the state. The question is why has it been illegal for so long?

Some people say that the answer lies in the origin of gambling prohibition. In 1911, California amended its Constitution to prohibit gambling. The amendment was spurred by anti-gambling crusader Rev. James Woods who argued that casinos and lotteries were “the mother of all evils.”

At the time, many Californians agreed with Rev. Woods. Gambling was seen as a vice that led to poverty and crime. But over time, public opinion has changed. A majority of people now believe that gambling can be a harmless form of entertainment – and one that could generate much-needed tax revenue for the state.

Others argue that the real reason gambling is illegal in California is because of the powerful casino lobby. The casino industry has a lot of money and political influence, and it doesn’t want competition from state-run lotteries and casinos.

Whatever the reason, it’s clear that Californians want change. A recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 66 percent of registered voters favor legalizing some forms of gambling, such as betting on horse races or playing poker in person or online. Only 28 percent were opposed to the idea.

If gambling is legalized in California, it could bring in billions of dollars in tax revenue each year. That would help solve some of our state’s budget problems – and it would create thousands of new jobs in the process.

#  Redditors Ask Why Gambling Is Illegal In California

As gambling becomes more and more popular in the United States, some states are still against it. California is one of those states. But, why is gambling illegal in California?

The answer to this question is a bit complicated. The first reason has to do with the history of gambling in California. Gambling was actually made illegal in the state in the late 1800s. This was largely because lawmakers were worried that it would ruin the state’s economy.

In addition, there is also a lot of controversy around gambling when it comes to morality. Some people believe that gambling is sinful and that it can lead to addiction and other problems.

Finally, there is also the issue of crime. Lawmakers are worried that legalized gambling will lead to an increase in crime rates. This is because criminals often target casinos and other places where people gamble for their money.

Despite all of these concerns, there have been efforts over the years to legalize gambling in California. However, these efforts have always been unsuccessful.

#  Californians Debate the Legality of Gambling

Californians have been debating the legality of gambling for years. Some people believe that it should be made legal, while others believe that it should remain illegal. Those in support of legalizing gambling argue that it would bring in much-needed revenue to the state, while those who oppose it say that it would lead to increased crime and social ills.

Those in favor of legalizing gambling argue that the benefits would outweigh the costs. They say that gambling is a harmless pastime for most people, and that the potential revenue from taxing it could be used to improve schools, roads, and other public services. They also argue that legalized gambling would create jobs and help to revive the state’s economy.

Those who oppose legalization claim that gambling is addictive and can lead to financial disaster for many people. They say that casinos can be a magnet for crime, and that they promote values and behaviors that are contrary to those of civil society.
