#  Do you believe that Eva Green was really 26 years old when she played in Casino Royale? 

There is some controversy over Eva Green's age when she starred in Casino Royale. Some people believe that she was only 26 years old when the movie was filmed, while others believe that she was actually 28 years old at the time. 

This discrepancy in her age comes from her date of birth being reported as July 6th, 1980, while some say that this is actually her birthday astrological sign, and that she was born on October 5th, 1980. 

If we go with the 6th of July as her true date of birth, then she would have only been 26 years old when she filmed Casino Royale. However, if we use the 5th of October as her true date of birth, then she would have been 28 years old at the time. 

So which is it? Was Eva Green really only 26 years old when Casino Royale was filmed, or did she turn 28? 

At this point, it's hard to say for sure. There isn't a lot of information out there about Eva Green's true age, and neither side has any definitive proof to support their argument. 

However, if we look at other films that Eva Green has starred in, it seems like she may have been closer to 28 years old when Casino Royale came out. For example, in 2010's The Dreamers - which was released 2 years after Casino Royale - Eva Green states her age as 30 years old. 

So what do you think? Was Eva Green really only 26 years old when Casino Royale came out? Or was she closer to 28?
